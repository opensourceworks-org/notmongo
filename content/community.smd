## About the author
Hi, I'm Loris Cro, the original creator of Zine.

I'm VP of Community at the [Zig Software Foundation](https://ziglang.org),
host of [Zig SHOWTIME](https://zig.show) and the curator of 
[Software You Can Love](https://softwareyoucan.love), a cycle of conferences 
that has run in Vancouver and [Milan](https://sycl.it). I also write on my 
personal blog at [https://kristoff.it](https://kristoff.it).

Each link in the previous section points to a static website authored 
by me. 

My journey in creating software  you can love has taught me that, if your
project is serious enough, **you will need a website and that in most cases a
*static* website will be exactly what you need**.

For this reason I've become interested in streamlining the static website 
building experience for myself and others who are interested in creating *experiences* you can love.

**Zine is tailored for creators who want to make simple, elegant websites
that reflect the attention to detail they already put in designing their main
product.**

Zine itself is designed according to this principle and this is why I've decided
to design the entire authoring experience of Zine from scratch, retaining ideas
that I appreciated from static site generators I've used in the past, and 
innovating whenever I believe a better way can be found.
