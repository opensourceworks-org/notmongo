## About
This guide assumes that you're already familiar with GitHub Pages. Please refer [the official GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/) for more info.

## 1. Use GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions runner have an inherent overhead and, since Zine is a collection of tools that gets compiled on-demand, your runner will need to do some work that wouldn't be necessary with a single-executable tool.

**Luckily, the build will be cached automatically by using [mlugg/setup-zig](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-zig-compiler)**.

[This site currently builds in 25-35 seconds](https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine-ssg.io/actions), of which 12 are spent setting up Zig, and 2 for the actual site build (the rest is GitHub Pages overhead).

**`.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`**
```
name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Set a branch to deploy
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Change if you need git info

      - name: Setup Zig
        uses: mlugg/setup-zig@v1
        with:
          version: 0.13.0
          
      - name: Build
        run: zig build --summary new
          
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./zig-out
```

## 2. Build locally
A more manual, but faster approach is to build the website locally and commit it to the correct branch/subdir. 

Currently Zine doesn't offer any help automating this process, but in the future it might.

>Currently Zine doesn't clean `zig-out/` across rebuilds so you will have to
>do it manually.
