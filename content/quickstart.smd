## 1. Get the Zig compiler

**Zine is in the process of becoming a fully self-contained executable**, but for now it heavily leverages the Zig build system, meaning that Zig is the only dependency you need.

We currently track Zig's **latest tagged release (0.13.0)**.

You can download it from from [the official website](https://ziglang.org) or use [zigup](https://github.com/marler8997/zigup).

## 2. Clone Zine's Sample Site

What's a better sample site than the official site itself?

**`shell`**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine-ssg.io.git
cd zine-ssg.io
zig build serve
```
After that, start hacking on it and see how Zine reacts!

Here are a handful of things that you might want to investigate:
- On first invocation it will take a moment for Zine to load, as it has to compile optimized versions of all its tools. Subsequent runs will be much faster.
- What happens if you rename `assets/style.css` to something else and try to rebuild the site?
- What happens if you put a wrong value in a link to a local page [like this one](/community)? (this page is `content/quickstart.smd`)


## 3. Get developer tooling
This step is optional but **strongly** recommended as it will give you access
to syntax highlighting, autoformatting and language server diagnostics for your
editor.

See the [Editor support](/docs/editors/) section.
