## What?
I'm discovering how DuckDB works internally. I've been using it mainly for ad hoc stuff with the excellent cli.
Also, I have a few use cases for accessing json data from api's.  Some are very simple, others are similar to MongoDB.

I will build a data fetcher for the excellent [json](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/json) extension, much like the [shellfs](https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/shellfs.html) 
extension works for shell commands.  

## Why this site?
Documenting for future self.  Also, there's this excellent *[at the boundary](https://blog.debug.sexy/)* blog. 
Started at about the same time I was looking into table functions. There was no good documentation and examples at the time of this writing.

## Where to start
- [duckdb: build extensions](https://duckdb.org/docs/dev/building/building_extensions.html)
- [at the boundary](https://blog.debug.sexy/): explains how to get started with table functions with examples. 
- read the duckdb extensions code: [json](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/extension/json/json_extension.cpp), [parquet](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/extension/parquet/parquet_extension.cpp)
- [table function source](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/main/src/function/table)

## Scalar functions
These return a single value. The [extension template](https://github.com/duckdb/extension-template) has the Quack example.

## Table functions
Obviously, these return tables.  Retrieve data, process schema and data types.
There are no good starters for this yet.  You can have a look at the parquet extension or the json extension, but they are a bit of a 
handful to get started with. 

Supports threaded execution.
