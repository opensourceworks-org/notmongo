## What is Zine?
A Zine site is a collection of content files and layouts.

Zine turns your content into HTML, styles it using your layouts, and
finally copies the result (alongside other assets like images) into an output directory
that you can then publish on static hosting services like GitHub Pages.

Zine uses a **structured approach to content authoring** that helps keeping sizeable
content collections manageable. Similarly, the build process uses **surgical
dependency tracking** to ensure minimal rebuilds, keeping the authoring experience
excellent at all scales.

*Zine is pronounced like in [fan**zine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine)*.
    
## A handcrafted authoring experience
Zine uses [SuperMD]($link.page('docs/supermd')) for content and 
[SuperHTML]($link.page('docs/superhtml')) for defining layouts.

SuperMD is an extension of Markdown that allows you to **define embedded assets 
and semantic constructs that would be impossible to express in Markdown** without
using inline HTML.

SuperHTML is an extension of HTML5 that focuses on expressing **correct templating
logic**. With SuperHTML it's **impossible to generate malformed HTML** and most
mistakes become **build time errors**.
